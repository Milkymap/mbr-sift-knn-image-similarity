This project allows you to find the occurrences of an image by scanning a database.
Two methods were used: knn and mbr-sift. The knn method allows us to find
more similar images based on some contextual similarity. That of mbr-sift is
then used on these candidates which are reassembled by knn in order to find the images which are
structurally similar.

# structure

this project is structured in a modular way, it is linked to several libraries such as **[opencv, numpy, flask, zmq, loguru, multiprocessing]** 
It contains the :
* following directories:
    * processing
        * allows to extract features from images 
        * use vgg16 as features extractor
    * dump
    	* should be created!
        * is the target location where features will be stored 
        * the features are 128 vector generated by PCA    
    * logger
        * contains log formatting and settings
        * based on loguru 
    * searching
        * contains the logic of finding nearest neighbors based on knn over 128_features  
        * apply MBR-SIFT on the output of knn
    * utilities
    	* core of the project 
    	* group a set of functionalies such as
    	* image procesing 
    	* path manipulation 
    	* MBR-SIFT strategy  
    * utils_readme
        * contains some image, font for readme rendering 
        * can be easily extended by the user 
* following files
    * docker and git confs
        * .dockerignore
        * .gitignore
    * project libraries
        * requirements.txt

# installation 
```bash
	git clone https://github.com/Milkymap/mbr-sift-knn-image-similarity
	cd mbr-sift-knn-image-similarity
	python -m venv env 
	source env/bin/activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# running 
```python
	# this script will load all images from the target dir 
	# ../mbr\[SIFT\]-image-similarity/source/ 
	# process those images and extractt their features
	# python -m processing.process --help : in order to have a good view of how it works  
	python -m processing.process 
		-s ../mbr\[SIFT\]-image-similarity/source/ 
		-t dump/descriptors.pkl 
		-m models/vgg16.pt  
		-f '*.jpg' 
		--dim 128
```

```python
	# this script load a source image and the extracted features
	# apply knn to get the nearest candiate according to a contextual similarity
	# apply MBR-SIFT on those candidate according to a structural similarity
	# it contains two subcommands:
	# nearest and search
	# those subcommand can be chained one after another 
	# python -m processing.process nearest --help : in order to have a good view of how it works
	# python -m processing.process search --help : in order to have a good view of how it works
	
	python -m searching.search 
		--debug
